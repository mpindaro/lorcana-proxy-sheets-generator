# Proxy Sheet Generator

This is a proxy sheet generator tool that allows you to create proxy sheets for non-commercial use. Proxy sheets are useful for printing out card proxies, which are replicas of original cards used for various purposes such as playtesting or collecting.

## Usage

To use this tool, you need to have Python installed on your system. Follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Make sure you have the `getDeck.py` file in the same directory as the generator script.
5. Run the following command to generate the proxy sheet:

    ```shell
    python proxy_generator.py
    ```

    This command will use the `getDeck.py` file to fetch the deck information and generate the proxy sheet.

6. The generated proxy sheet will be saved in the output directory.
